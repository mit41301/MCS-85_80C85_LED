# MCS-85 family self modifying program
We can easily change the program during RUN TIME during execution of any **MCS-85** like intel **8085** program. Since the running program itself will change the program code, the entire program should be located in **RAM** memory. If the running program is located in ROM or EPROM memory address space, the program can not modify the program. Please note that we are not changing any DATA inside the program, instead we are changing the program itself!

## LED Running EXAMPLE

The simple program with memory location and opcodes listed like below
