# MCS-85 family self modifying program
We can easily change the program during RUN TIME during execution of any program. Since the running program itself will change the program code, the entire program should be located in RAM memory. If the running program is located in ROM or EPROM memory address space, the program can not modify the program.

## LED Running EXAMPLE
### 8 LEDs running Left and Right between LSB to MSB
